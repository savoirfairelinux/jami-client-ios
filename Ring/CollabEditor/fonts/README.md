# Document fonts

The fonts a collaborative document can name. A run of text is set in one of
them through the inline attribute `"font"`, holding one of the ids below; text
without the attribute is drawn in the editor's own font. The desktop and
Android clients ship the same files under the same ids, so the lists have to be
kept in step: an id is part of the document format. Here the list is
`DOCUMENT_FONTS` in `../src/fonts.js`.

Each family comes as four static TrueType files: `-Regular`, `-Bold`,
`-Italic` and `-BoldItalic`.

All of them are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, which lets them
be bundled with Jami and embedded in the documents it exports. Each family's
license sits next to its files (`*-OFL.txt`, `Liberation-LICENSE.txt`).

The page loads a file only once text set in its font is on screen, from the
`jami-collab:` scheme, which serves these files and nothing else.

The files are the upstream releases, unmodified, and are to be kept that way:
several of these fonts reserve their names, which a modified version -- a
subset, a conversion to another format -- may not carry.
