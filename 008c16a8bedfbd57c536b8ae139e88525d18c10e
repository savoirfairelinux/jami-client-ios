      "message": "Conversations could be simplified. Conversations would not change while the contact picker is present because it requires user input. Therefore, we could directly use self.conversationsService.conversations.value without observing changes. In this case, there would be no need to use foundConversationViewModel to check if a conversation has already been added. However, it is important to consider the search bar entry, as conversations may need to be filtered(see searchResultItems)",
