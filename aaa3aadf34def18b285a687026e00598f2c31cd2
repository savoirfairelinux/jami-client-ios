      "message": "Goal of a letter in a circle is to make the icon more personal and increase engagement if we don\u0027t have a profile picture for a contact.\nI think that using \"R\" as a default replacement lettre defeats the purpose of lettre icons and makes more likely that a contact named \"Roman\" (with a name starting with \"R\") will be ignored when the user scans the letters.\nIMO if we don\u0027t even have a username or profile name, then no lettre should be shown at all, since the name of the contact doesn\u0027t start by \"R\", and the \"ring:\" prefix is purely technical and is not expected to be known/understood by users.  It would be like using \"H\" for an icon of a webpage.\nIn this case a placeholder contact icon can be used instead (maybe tinted with a color derived from the contact URI).",
