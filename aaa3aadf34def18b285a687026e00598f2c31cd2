      "message": "Goal of a letter in a circle is to make the icon more personal and increase engagement if we don\u0027t have a profile picture for a contact.\nI think that using \"R\" as a default replacement lettre defeats the purpose of lettre icons and makes more likely that a contact named \"Roman\" (with a name starting with \"R\") will be ignored when the user scans the letters.\nIMO if we don\u0027t even have a username or profile name, then no lettre should be shown at all, since the name of the contact doesn\u0027t start by \"R\", and the \"ring:\" prefix is purely technical and is not expected to be known/understood by users.  It would be like using \"H\" for an icon of a webpage.\nIn this case a placeholder contact icon can be used instead (maybe tinted with a color derived from the contact URI).",

      "message": "Indeed should be consistent in all clients\n\n* a raw RingID will show when no username have been registered and no profile name is available. This will be the case in many scenarios\n* a raw RingID has no personal/literal meaning and is not meant to be read/remembered by humans (at worst, it might be visually compared with other RingIDs). Also the first char is often a number that can be misled for an amount of unread stuff. IMO we should not use the first letter of the raw ringID for the icon\n* showing a gray or colored plain contact icon for \"ringID\" contacts seems reasonable in this scenario, where there is no name of any kind available for a contact\n* other idea ?",
